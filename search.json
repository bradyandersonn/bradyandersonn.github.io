    "text": "The 2024 Big Ten season was one of the most competitive in recent memory. Several teams outperformed their preseason expectations, while others struggled to find consistency.\nHere’s a breakdown of how each team’s offensive and defensive efficiency contributed to their success.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\n# Big Ten Basketball in 2024: Which Teams Exceeded Expectations?\n\npreseason &lt;- tibble(\n  Team = c(\"Purdue\", \"Michigan State\", \"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Ohio State\", \n           \"Maryland\", \"Michigan\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Iowa\", \"Rutgers\", \n           \"Penn State\", \"Northwestern\", \"Minnesota\", \"Nebraska\"),\n  Preseason_Rank = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14),\n  Period = \"Preseason\"\n)\n\n# Final rankings\nfinal &lt;- tibble(\n  Team = c(\"Purdue\", \"Illinois\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Nebraska\", \"Northwestern\", \n           \"Michigan State\", \"Iowa\", \"Ohio State\", \"Indiana\", \"Penn State\",\n           \"Michigan\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Minnesota\"),\n  Final_Rank = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14),\n  Period = \"Final\"\n)\n\n# Results with stats\nresults &lt;- tibble(\n  Team = c(\"Purdue\", \"Illinois\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Nebraska\", \"Northwestern\", \n           \"Michigan State\", \"Iowa\", \"Ohio State\", \"Indiana\", \"Penn State\",\n           \"Michigan\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Minnesota\"),\n  Conf_Finish = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14),\n  Overall_W = c(34, 29, 24, 23, 21, 20, 19, 21, 19, 21, 18, 16, 15, 9),\n  Overall_L = c(4, 9, 14, 11, 12, 15, 15, 14, 15, 14, 18, 17, 18, 22),\n  ORtg = c(119.5, 115.2, 112.8, 108.4, 111.3, 110.7, 114.6, 110.9, 109.5, 107.8, \n           108.2, 109.1, 106.3, 103.5),\n  DRtg = c(97.8, 101.5, 100.2, 102.8, 103.5, 104.2, 105.8, 104.6, 105.1, 106.3,\n           107.5, 108.9, 109.2, 112.4)\n)\n# Combine datasets\ncombined &lt;- preseason |&gt;\n  left_join(final, by = \"Team\") |&gt;\n  left_join(results, by = \"Team\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Win_Pct = Overall_W / (Overall_W + Overall_L),\n    Performance_Diff = Preseason_Rank - Conf_Finish\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined) +\n  geom_bar(aes(\n    x = reorder(Team, Performance_Diff),\n    weight = Performance_Diff,\n    fill = Performance_Diff\n  )) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"red\", high = \"green\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Big Ten Teams: Preseason Expectations vs Final Standing\",\n    subtitle = \"Positive values mean teams exceeded expectations\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Rank Change\",\n    fill = \"Change\",\n    caption = \"Sources: InsideNU (Media Poll), Sports-Reference CBB, KenPom, ESPN/On3\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0),\n    plot.caption = element_text(\n      size = 7,\n      hjust = 1,\n      color = \"gray40\",\n      margin = margin(t = 15)\n    ),\n    plot.margin = margin(10, 20, 30, 10)\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows how each Big Ten team performed compared to preseason expectations. Nebraska was the breakout story, finishing about ten spots higher than predicted.\nNorthwestern and Wisconsin also impressed, staying consistent all year. Meanwhile, teams like Maryland and Indiana couldn’t find their footing and finished far below where most thought they’d be.\nWith several programs underperforming and Purdue landing exactly as expected, the Huskers’ rise stood out even more.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined) +\n  geom_point(aes(\n    x = ORtg,\n    y = Win_Pct,\n    color = Team == \"Nebraska\"\n  ), size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray70\", \"red\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = ORtg, y = Win_Pct, label = Team),\n            hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.5, size = 1.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Offensive Efficiency and Winning in the Big Ten\",\n    subtitle = \"Nebraska stands out compared to the rest of the conference\",\n    x = \"Offensive Rating\",\n    y = \"Win Percentage\",\n    color = \"Nebraska?\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Sports-Reference CBB, KenPom, ESPN Team Pages\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"plain\", size = 10, hjust = 0),\n    plot.caption = element_text(\n      size = 7,\n      hjust = 1,\n      color = \"gray40\",\n      margin = margin(t = 15)   # LOWER CAPTION BY 15\n    )\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s where things get interesting. Purdue had the top offense in the Big Ten but still won less than 30% of its games, a clear sign that offense alone doesn’t win.\nIowa proved the opposite, winning over 75% of its games with an average attack by steady defense and execution. Nebraska followed a similar path, relying on toughness instead of pure scoring.\nIt’s a reminder that highlight plays don’t mean much without stops on the other end.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined) +\n  geom_point(aes(\n    x = ORtg,\n    y = DRtg,\n    size = abs(Performance_Diff),\n    color = Performance_Diff\n  ), alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = ORtg, y = DRtg, label = Team),\n            hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.5, size = 1.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"When the Numbers Don’t Tell the Whole Story\",\n    subtitle = \"Bubble size shows how far teams missed preseason expectations\",\n    x = \"Offensive Rating\",\n    y = \"Defensive Rating\",\n    size = \"Performance Gap\",\n    color = \"Gap Value\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Big Ten Media Poll (InsideNU), Sports-Reference CBB, KenPom, ESPN/On3\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"plain\", size = 10, hjust = 0),\n    plot.caption = element_text(\n      size = 7,\n      hjust = 1,\n      color = \"gray40\",\n      margin = margin(t = 15)   # lowers the caption\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# export data\nwrite_csv(combined, \"big_ten_basketball_data.csv\")  \n\n\nThis final chart ties it all together by comparing offense, defense, and expectations.\nMinnesota’s balance didn’t translate into wins, while Purdue’s big numbers couldn’t cover for defensive struggles. Northwestern and Wisconsin once again outperformed through smart play and chemistry.\nIowa’s steady two-way game rounds it outthey didn’t dominate any one stat, but they won where it counted. In the end, the teams that mixed effort, discipline, and cohesion rose above the rest."
