    "text": "The 2024 Big Ten men’s basketball season was really competitive. Some teams did way better than people expected, while others didn’t do as well as predicted. I wanted to see which teams surprised everyone the most. By looking at their offense and defense, we can figure out who exceeded expectations and who fell short.\nHere’s a breakdown of how each team’s offensive and defensive efficiency contributed to their success.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\n\n\npreseason &lt;- tibble(\n  Team = c(\"Purdue\", \"Michigan State\", \"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Ohio State\", \n           \"Maryland\", \"Michigan\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Iowa\", \"Rutgers\", \n           \"Penn State\", \"Northwestern\", \"Minnesota\", \"Nebraska\"),\n  Preseason_Rank = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14),\n  Period = \"Preseason\"\n)\n\n\nfinal &lt;- tibble(\n  Team = c(\"Purdue\", \"Illinois\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Nebraska\", \"Northwestern\", \n           \"Michigan State\", \"Iowa\", \"Ohio State\", \"Indiana\", \"Penn State\",\n           \"Michigan\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Minnesota\"),\n  Final_Rank = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14),\n  Period = \"Final\"\n)\n\n\nresults &lt;- tibble(\n  Team = c(\"Purdue\", \"Illinois\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Nebraska\", \"Northwestern\", \n           \"Michigan State\", \"Iowa\", \"Ohio State\", \"Indiana\", \"Penn State\",\n           \"Michigan\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Minnesota\"),\n  Conf_Finish = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14),\n  Overall_W = c(34, 29, 24, 23, 21, 20, 19, 21, 19, 21, 18, 16, 15, 9),\n  Overall_L = c(4, 9, 14, 11, 12, 15, 15, 14, 15, 14, 18, 17, 18, 22),\n  ORtg = c(119.5, 115.2, 112.8, 108.4, 111.3, 110.7, 114.6, 110.9, 109.5, 107.8, \n           108.2, 109.1, 106.3, 103.5),\n  DRtg = c(97.8, 101.5, 100.2, 102.8, 103.5, 104.2, 105.8, 104.6, 105.1, 106.3,\n           107.5, 108.9, 109.2, 112.4)\n)\n\ncombined &lt;- preseason |&gt;\n  left_join(final, by = \"Team\") |&gt;\n  left_join(results, by = \"Team\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Win_Pct = Overall_W / (Overall_W + Overall_L),\n    Performance_Diff = Preseason_Rank - Conf_Finish\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined) +\n  geom_bar(aes(\n    x = reorder(Team, Performance_Diff),\n    weight = Performance_Diff,\n    fill = Performance_Diff\n  )) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"red\", high = \"green\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which Big Ten Teams Beat Expectations in 2024\",\n    subtitle = \"Positive values mean teams exceeded expectations\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Rank Change\",\n    fill = \"Change\",\n    caption = \"Sources: InsideNU (Media Poll), Sports-Reference CBB, KenPom, ESPN/On3\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0),\n    plot.caption = element_text(\n      size = 7,\n      hjust = 1,\n      color = \"gray40\",\n      margin = margin(t = 15)\n    ),\n    plot.margin = margin(10, 20, 30, 10)\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nThis chart shows how each Big Ten team performed compared to preseason expectations. Nebraska was the breakout story, finishing about ten spots higher than predicted.\nNorthwestern and Wisconsin also impressed, staying consistent all year. Meanwhile, teams like Maryland and Indiana couldn’t find their footing and finished far below where most thought they’d be.\nWith several programs underperforming and Purdue landing exactly as expected, the Huskers’ rise stood out even more.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined) +\n  geom_point(aes(\n    x = ORtg,\n    y = Win_Pct,\n    color = Team == \"Nebraska\"\n  ), size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray70\", \"red\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = ORtg, y = Win_Pct, label = Team),\n            hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.5, size = 1.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Offensive Efficiency and Winning in the Big Ten\",\n    subtitle = \"Nebraska stands out compared to the rest of the conference\",\n    x = \"Offensive Rating\",\n    y = \"Win Percentage\",\n    color = \"Nebraska?\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Sports-Reference CBB, KenPom, ESPN Team Pages\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"plain\", size = 10, hjust = 0),\n    plot.caption = element_text(\n      size = 7,\n      hjust = 1,\n      color = \"gray40\",\n      margin = margin(t = 15)  \n    )\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart show teams’ offensive efficiency relates to winning.\nPurdue had the highest offense and also the highest win percentage, showing their scoring helped them dominate the season.\nNebraska and Iowa didn’t have the top offense but still won a good number of games, showing that strong defense and smart, disciplined play can compete with high-scoring teams.\nThis chart reminds us that offense helps, but defense and teamwork are also critical to winning.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined) +\n  geom_point(aes(\n    x = ORtg,\n    y = DRtg,\n    size = abs(Performance_Diff),\n    color = Performance_Diff\n  ), alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = ORtg, y = DRtg, label = Team),\n            hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.5, size = 1.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"When the Numbers Don’t Tell the Whole Story\",\n    subtitle = \"Bubble size shows how far teams missed preseason expectations\",\n    x = \"Offensive Rating\",\n    y = \"Defensive Rating\",\n    size = \"Performance Gap\",\n    color = \"Gap Value\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Big Ten Media Poll (InsideNU), Sports-Reference CBB, KenPom, ESPN/On3\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"plain\", size = 10, hjust = 0),\n    plot.caption = element_text(\n      size = 7,\n      hjust = 1,\n      color = \"gray40\",\n      margin = margin(t = 15)   \n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# export data\nwrite_csv(combined, \"big_ten_basketball_data.csv\")  \n\n\nThis final chart ties it all together by comparing offense, defense, and expectations.\nMinnesota’s balance didn’t translate into wins, while Purdue’s big numbers couldn’t cover for defensive struggles. Northwestern and Wisconsin once again outperformed through smart play and chemistry.\nIowa’s steady two-way game rounds it outthey didn’t dominate any one stat, but they won where it counted. In the end, the teams that mixed effort, discipline, and cohesion rose above the rest.\nOverall, the graphs show that Nebraska was the biggest overachiever in the Big Ten, finishing far higher than expected and proving that strong defense and consistent play can outweigh pure offensive numbers. Wisconsin and Northwestern also beat expectations with balanced, disciplined basketball, while Maryland, Indiana, and Michigan fell short of their preseason hype. Purdue was the one team that landed exactly where predicted, using elite offense and steady performance to match expectations. Together, the visuals make it clear that while stats matter, the teams that exceeded expectations did so by staying consistent, playing smart, and finding ways to win when it counted."
