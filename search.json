    "title": "Are Thursday Night Football Games “Worse” in 2024?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Fans love to complain about Thursday Night Football (TNF)!\nOften things commonly said are like, “The short week makes the games sloppy,” or “They’re low quality!” But is that really true?\nI decided to dive into NFL play-by-play data from the 2024 season to see if TNF games actually live up or down to the hype. I compared Thursday games to all other match ups using three key stats, total points scored, turnovers, and yards per play.\nIf TNF games were truly boring, we’d expect them to have lower scoring. So for this first graph plotted total points for every NFL game in 2024. Each dot represents a single game, and the boxplots show the median and range for Thursday games versus all other games.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nu &lt;- \"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2024/games.htm\"\np &lt;- read_html(u)\n\n\ncomments &lt;- html_nodes(p, xpath = \"//comment()\")\ncomments &lt;- html_text(comments)\nhas_table &lt;- comments[str_detect(comments, \"&lt;table\")]\n\n\nif (length(has_table) &gt; 0) {\n  tmp_html &lt;- read_html(has_table[1])\n  games_df &lt;- html_table(tmp_html, fill = TRUE)[[1]]\n  games_df &lt;- clean_names(games_df)\n} else {\n  games_df &lt;- html_table(p)[[1]]\n  games_df &lt;- clean_names(games_df)\n}\n\n\npts_cols &lt;- names(games_df)[str_detect(names(games_df), \"pts\")]\ngames_df &lt;- games_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(all_of(pts_cols), ~ as.numeric(.)))\n\n\ngames_df &lt;- games_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    total = rowSums(select(., all_of(pts_cols)), na.rm = TRUE),\n    type = ifelse(day == \"Thu\", \"TNF\", \"Other\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(total))\n\n\nggplot(games_df, aes(x = type, y = total, color = type)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgreen\", outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"TNF Games Score About the Same as Other NFL Games\",\n    x = \"Game Type\",\n    y = \"Total Points Scored\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),  \n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9)                 \n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TNF boxplot looks almost identical to the rest of the league. Showing offenses aren’t slowing down just because it’s Thursday. Even if fans feel like Thursday games are low energy, the numbers tell a different story.\nNext let’s look turnovers as they are one of the most visible signs of sloppy football.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nflfastR)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\npbp_2024 &lt;- load_pbp(2024) %&gt;%\n  filter(season_type == \"REG\")\n\ngame_stats &lt;- pbp_2024 %&gt;%\n  mutate(turnover_play = case_when(\n    !is.na(fumble_lost) & fumble_lost == 1 ~ 1,\n    !is.na(interception) & interception == 1 ~ 1,\n    TRUE ~ 0\n  )) %&gt;%\n  group_by(game_id, game_date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    turnovers = sum(turnover_play),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    type = if_else(\n      wday(as.Date(game_date), label = TRUE) == \"Thu\",\n      \"TNF\",\n      \"Other\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(game_stats, aes(x = type, y = turnovers)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"skyblue\", outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, color = \"darkblue\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Turnovers Don’t Increase on Thursday Night\",\n    x = \"Game Type\",\n    y = \"Number of Turnovers\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflfastR\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 20),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9)\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFans often point to one or two messy TNF games and generalize, but the data shows that across the season, Thursday games aren’t more turnover prone than others and they are about the same for any other game.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nflfastR)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\npbp_2024 &lt;- load_pbp(2024) %&gt;% filter(season_type == \"REG\")\n\ngame_stats &lt;- pbp_2024 %&gt;%\n  mutate(turnover_play = case_when(\n    !is.na(fumble_lost) & fumble_lost == 1 ~ 1,\n    !is.na(interception) & interception == 1 ~ 1,\n    TRUE ~ 0\n  )) %&gt;%\n  group_by(game_id, game_date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    turnovers = sum(turnover_play),\n    yards_per_play = sum(yards_gained, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(play_type %in% c(\"pass\",\"run\")),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    type = if_else(\n      wday(as.Date(game_date), label = TRUE) == \"Thu\",\n      \"TNF\",\n      \"Other\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(turnovers) & turnovers &gt;= 0)\n\nggplot(game_stats, aes(x = turnovers, y = yards_per_play, color = type)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"TNF\" = \"red\", \"Other\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Efficiency and Mistake Rates Show TNF Games Hold Up\",\n    x = \"Turnovers per Game\",\n    y = \"Yards per Play\",\n    color = \"Game Type\",\n    caption = \"Source: nflfastR\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs my last point, I looked at turnovers and offensive efficiency together. If TNF games were worse, we’d expect them to cluster toward more turnovers and fewer yards per play.\nThe surprising thing is that TNF games overlap heavily with the rest of the league. The trend lines are nearly identical.\nEven when considering mistakes and efficiency together, Thursday games perform right alongside Sunday games. This shows that short weeks don’t necessarily lead to worse football, they just feel different because we’re used to Sunday or Monday games.\nLooking at scoring, turnovers, and overall efficiency, the data shows not many of TNF games being “worse”. TNF might feel different because of routine or expectation, but the numbers prove that it can be just as entertaining and competitive as any Sunday match up."

    "text": "The 2024 Big Ten men’s basketball season was really competitive. Some teams did way better than people expected, while others didn’t do as well as predicted.

Northwestern and Wisconsin once again outperformed through smart play and chemistry.\nIowa’s steady two-way game rounds it outthey didn’t dominate any one stat, but they won where it counted. In the end, the teams that mixed effort, discipline, and cohesion rose above the rest.\nOverall, the graphs show that Nebraska was the biggest overachiever in the Big Ten, finishing far higher than expected and proving that strong defense and consistent play can outweigh pure offensive numbers. Wisconsin and Northwestern also beat expectations with balanced, disciplined basketball, while Maryland, Indiana, and Michigan fell short of their preseason hype. Purdue was the one team that landed exactly where predicted, using elite offense and steady performance to match expectations. Together, the visuals make it clear that while stats matter, the teams that exceeded expectations did so by staying consistent, playing smart, and finding ways to win when it counted."
